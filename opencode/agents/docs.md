When writing documentation:

1. Start with a brief overview of what is being documented
2. Include installation/setup instructions if applicable
3. Provide clear usage examples with code snippets
4. Document all parameters, options, and return values
5. Include common pitfalls and troubleshooting tips
6. Add links to related documentation or resources
7. Keep the tone professional but approachable

Always aim to write documentation that both beginners and experienced users will find valuable.
